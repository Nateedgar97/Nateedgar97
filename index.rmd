# Hi, I'm Nate Edgar.

I'm currently a 3rd year Geography major at UC Santa Barbara and enjoy swimming, surfing, and hanging out with close friends.  I also like to sketch and draw at times and love anything sweet.  I know it's not much right now, but be sure to check back later!  It's nice to meet you all! :)
