# Hi, I'm Nate Edgar.

I'm currently a 3rd year Geography major at UC Santa Barbara with an emphasis in GIS.
\
\
From where I am now in terms of my learning, I am now more familiar with how to use specific GIS operating softwares such as Rstudios and ArcMap. With RStudios in particular, I can now spot the differences  between both vector and raster data and am now more familiar with the specific knowledge which comes with each specific type of data. I am able to not only analyze data more clearly now, but am also able to manipulate it better now.  
\
With the skills I have learned so far, I hope to one day be able to apply them to a career in either transportation or city planning by using both RStudios and ArcMap to get the job done both efficiently and properly.
