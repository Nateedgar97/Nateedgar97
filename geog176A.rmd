title: Nateâ€™s GIS Projects
---

As apart of my 1st GIS class I took at the UC Santa Barbara in the summer of 2020, I was able to get some experience with the GIS software RStudios and with that I have created this specific webpage to keep track of all the the assignments we have completed throughout the quarter. Please enjoy! :) 


## Lab 1: Data Science Workflows (Making the Website!)

In this assignment we built a static users site using Github Pages which also included a github repo for access to all the code.

## [Lab 2: Data Wrangling](https://nateedgar97.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-02-nate--new-.html)
